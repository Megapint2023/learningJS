<h1>ASSIGNMENT:</h1>
<h3>Advanced. Routing with digitransit . <br>
   •Not for the faint-hearted. <br>
   •Don't do this if it interferes with the project. <br>
   •It's not worth it. <br>
    ... <br>
   •Create an app that shows the route from user defined address to school (Karaportti 2). <br>
   •You need to have a form where user adds an address. <br>
    After the form is submitted, the route is displayed on a map. <br>
    Show also the starting and ending time of the trip. <br>
    Not each part, just the start and end times. <br>
   •Example: JS, HTML <br>
       •You'll need this Leaflet plugin to make the example work. <br>
   •Here is an example on how to use places/addresses with coordinates. <br>
       •To get coordinates from address, you can use address search <br>
       •If you get cors errors (which is likely not going to happen) use this fix. <br>
